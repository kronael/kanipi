# Gateway Routing

**Status**: done

The gateway has one routing table. Messages arrive on a JID,
the router scans the table, and resolves a destination folder.
Groups are folder configs — they don't own JIDs or routing
rules.

## Concepts

- **JID** — a chat identifier (`telegram:123`, `discord:456`).
  The source of inbound messages. Not owned by any group.
- **Group** — a folder with config (name, container_config,
  tier). Receives messages via routing or delegation. Has no
  JID.
- **Route** — a rule in the routing table. Maps a JID +
  condition to a destination folder.

## Routing table

One flat ordered table in the gateway. Each row:

```sql
CREATE TABLE routes (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  jid TEXT NOT NULL,         -- which JID this rule applies to
  seq INTEGER NOT NULL,      -- evaluation order (lower first)
  type TEXT NOT NULL,        -- command/verb/pattern/keyword/sender/default
  match TEXT,                -- trigger/pattern/keyword/verb value
  target TEXT NOT NULL       -- destination folder
);
```

### Evaluation

Message arrives on JID:

1. Select all routes for that JID, ordered by `seq`
2. Scan rules, first match wins:
   - `command` — message starts with `match` value
   - `verb` — message verb equals `match`
   - `pattern` — regex `match` against message text
   - `keyword` — case-insensitive substring
   - `sender` — regex `match` against sender name/JID
   - `default` — always matches (catch-all)
3. Match found → destination folder. No match → drop (no
   group handles this JID).

No hops, no chains. One scan, one destination.

### Example

```
routes for telegram:1112184352 (DM):
  seq=0  command  @root    → root
  seq=1  default  *        → atlas

routes for telegram:-1003805633088 (group chat):
  seq=0  default  *        → atlas/support
```

DM message "hello" → atlas. DM message "@root status" → root.
Group message → atlas/support.

## Groups table

Groups are folder configs. No JID, no routing rules.

```sql
CREATE TABLE groups (
  folder TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  added_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  container_config TEXT,
  parent TEXT
);
```

Tier is derived from folder path (same as today):

```typescript
function permissionTier(folder: string): 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 {
  if (folder === 'root') return 0;
  return Math.min(folder.split('/').length, 3);
}
```

## IPC actions

### Routing (gateway-level)

- `get_routes` — read routes for a JID (or all)
- `add_route` — add a single route rule for a JID
- `delete_route` — remove a route rule by ID

Tier 0 can modify any routes. Tier 1 can modify routes
targeting folders in its own subtree. Tier 2+ cannot
modify routes.

### Delegation (agent-level)

- `delegate_group` — send a prompt to another group's
  agent. Root world can delegate anywhere. Others can
  only delegate to descendants in the same world.
- `escalate_group` — send a prompt to the parent group.

Delegation is an agent choice at runtime. Routing is
gateway-level, pre-spawn.

## IPC delegation auth

Root world groups (`root`, `root/*`) can delegate to any
folder. Other groups can only delegate to descendants in
their own subtree.

```typescript
function isAuthorizedRoutingTarget(src: string, dst: string): boolean {
  if (src.split('/')[0] === 'root') return true;
  const srcWorld = src.split('/')[0];
  const dstWorld = dst.split('/')[0];
  if (srcWorld !== dstWorld) return false;
  return dst.startsWith(src + '/');
}
```

## Migration from registered_groups

**Done** (migration 0005). The old `registered_groups` table
merged JID mapping, group config, and routing rules into one row.
It has been replaced by:

1. `groups` table — folder-keyed config (name, container_config,
   parent, trigger_pattern, slink_token, etc.)
2. `routes` table — flat JID → folder routing rules
3. `registered_groups` table dropped

## Error handling

**No route match**: Message is stored but not processed.
Gateway logs at debug level. No agent runs.

**Route match, delegation fails** (target can't spawn):
Message cursor advances (marked as processed). Gateway
logs error. No retry — message is "dropped" but still in
DB for parent access via MCP message history tools.

**Authorization check**: Happens at route creation time
(IPC actions), not at runtime. If a route exists, it's
followed. Bad routes in DB are the operator's problem.

**Dynamic delegation** (`delegate_group`): unauthorized
target → error reply via IPC. The agent handles it.

## Open

- Strip command prefix before child sees it: per-rule
  flag or always-strip?
- Circular delegation: detect via depth counter (max 3).
- Broadcast mode: route to multiple targets. Out of scope.
- Wildcard JID routes (`*`) for catch-all across all chats.
