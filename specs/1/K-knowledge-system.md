# Knowledge System

**Status**: partial

The pattern underlying diary, facts, episodes, and user context.
Each is an instance of: markdown files in a directory, with
summaries selected and injected into agent context.

## Memory Layers

| Layer    | Spec                   | Status  | Storage   |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Messages | memory-messages.md     | shipped | DB (SQL)  |
| Session  | memory-session.md      | shipped | SDK (.jl) |
| Managed  | memory-managed.md      | shipped | Files     |
| Diary    | memory-diary.md        | shipped | Files     |
| Facts    | 2/3-memory-facts.md    | v2      | Files     |
| Episodes | 3/B-memory-episodic.md | v2      | Files     |

Diary has agent-side skills (write/read) and gateway-side injection
(shipped v0.7.0). Other push layers (user context, episodes) not yet
built. Pull layers (facts search) not yet built.

## The pattern

Given a directory of markdown files:

1. **Index** — scan files, extract summaries (frontmatter or first N lines)
2. **Select** — choose which summaries to inject (by recency, sender, relevance)
3. **Inject** — insert selected summaries into agent prompt context
4. **Nudge** — at defined moments, prompt the agent to write/update files

## What fits this pattern

**Push layers** — small corpus, gateway injects automatically:

- **Diary** (`diary/*.md`) — date-keyed, 2 most recent, injected on
  session start via `formatDiaryXml()` in `index.ts` (shipped v0.7.0).
  Agent writes via `/diary` skill.
- **User context** (`users/*.md`) — sender-keyed, match by message
  sender, inject on every message. Agent writes on first encounter.
- **Episodes** (`episodes/*.md`) — event-keyed, all or recent,
  inject on session start. Agent writes on notable events.

**Pull layers** — large corpus, agent searches on demand:

- **Facts** (`facts/*.md`) — topic-keyed, too many to inject all.
  Agent uses search tool (RAG/grep) to find relevant files.
  Researcher subagent writes; verifier reviews before merge.

Push and pull are fundamentally different. Push layers need gateway
code (read files, format XML, inject into prompt). Pull layers need
a search tool (MCP server or skill) and a write process (researcher).
Don't try to unify them into one mechanism.

Messages, sessions, and MEMORY.md have their own implementations
and aren't forced into this pattern (see layer table above).

## Injection format

Push layers format selected summaries as XML, inserted into prompt:

```xml
<knowledge layer="diary" count="2">
  <entry key="20260306" age="today">summary text</entry>
  <entry key="20260305" age="yesterday">summary text</entry>
</knowledge>

<knowledge layer="user" count="1">
  <entry key="alice">Backend dev, works on validator-bonds</entry>
</knowledge>
```

## Nudges

Prompt the agent to write/update knowledge files:

- Hook-based: PreCompact, Stop, session start
- Message-based: first message from unknown user
- Skill-based: `/diary`, `/research`
- Scheduled: cron triggers researcher

Nudge text comes from skill config, not hardcoded in gateway.

## Push layer implementation (first to build)

The gateway needs a minimal knowledge injector:

1. Read configured directories of `.md` files
2. Parse YAML frontmatter or first N lines as summary
3. Select entries (by recency, by key match)
4. Format as XML block, prepend to agent prompt

This is ~100 lines of code. Start with diary injection (already
has agent-side skills), then user context.

## Pull layer implementation

Facts are too numerous to inject. The agent needs:

1. A search tool — MCP server with `search_knowledge(query)`
   backed by embeddings (Ollama at 10.0.5.1:11434) or grep
2. A write process — researcher subagent triggered by knowledge
   gaps or explicit request
3. A quality gate — verifier reviews researcher output before
   facts are committed

See `specs/atlas/researcher.md` for the write process.

## Open questions

- Should push layers be declarative (config) or imperative (code
  per layer)? Start with code — abstract only if a third layer
  looks identical to the first two.
- Performance: scanning 500 fact files for search index?
  Cache index in memory, refresh on file change.
- Researcher quality: auto-commit facts or require review?
  Unreviewed auto-injection is a misinformation pipeline.
- Can the agent self-inject by reading files instead of gateway
  injection? (Agent can always read — injection is optimization
  for consistent context.)

## Relationship to existing specs

These specs describe specific layers built on this pattern:

- `specs/1/L-memory-diary.md` — diary layer (agent skills + gateway
  injection shipped)
- `specs/v3/memory-facts.md` — facts layer (designed, not built)
- `specs/v3/memory-episodic.md` — episodes layer (designed, not built)
- `specs/atlas/user-context.md` — user layer (designed, not built)
- `specs/atlas/researcher.md` — writes to facts layer (designed, not built)

These specs describe different systems, NOT instances of this pattern:

- `specs/1/P-memory-session.md` — SDK state (container-runner.ts)
- `specs/1/N-memory-messages.md` — DB rows (router.ts SQL)
- `specs/v3/memory-managed.md` — MEMORY.md (Claude Code native)
