# Experiment 1 — SDK stale session ID behavior — DONE

## Result

Ran on hel1v5 with `kanipi-agent:latest`, bad session
`00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`:

```
[agent-runner] Starting query (session: 00000000-..., resumeAt: latest)...
[agent-runner] [msg #1] type=result subtype=error_during_execution
{"status":"success","result":null}
[agent-runner] Session initialized: fa649547-7d60-4ee9-b579-f09be6a7d0fe
[agent-runner] Result #2: subtype=success text=Not logged in · Please run /login
{"status":"success","result":"Not logged in · Please run /login","newSessionId":"fa649547-..."}
[agent-runner] Agent error: Claude Code process exited with code 1
{"status":"error","result":null,"newSessionId":"00000000-...","error":"Claude Code process exited with code 1"}
exit: 1
```

## Findings

1. SDK silently recovers: `error_during_execution` on bad resume → new session
   started automatically (`fa649547...`)
2. Agent-runner exits with code 1 and emits `status: error` with the
   **original bad ID** as `newSessionId` — the new session UUID is lost
3. Gateway currently does not handle `status: error` — stored session ID
   stays stale forever

## Fix shipped

`container/agent-runner/src/index.ts` — `runQuery` now catches the SDK
throw internally. If `resultCount > 0`, swallows the error and returns
normally with the captured `newSessionId`. The `main()` catch block no
longer sees it and does not write a spurious `status: error`.

## E2e test needed

Run the same `docker run` command from the plan section above after
rebuilding the agent image. Expected new behavior:

- Only one output block, `status: success`, with the new session UUID
- No `status: error` output
- Exit code 0

Add this to the smoke test suite (`make smoke`) so stale-session recovery
is verified on every agent image build.
