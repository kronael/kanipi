# Group Permissions

**Status**: partial

Four-tier permission model. Core enforcement is shipped. Two items remain open.

## Terminology

- **Tier 0**: root (instance admin)
- **Tier 1**: world (top-level folder)
- **Tier 2**: agent (group container)
- **Tier 3**: worker (subagent/sandboxed)

## Problem

Binary root/non-root was not enough. The gateway needs:

- an instance root with broad control
- top-level worlds isolated from one another
- deeper agent/worker groups with narrower permissions
- mount restrictions that reduce prompt-injection blast radius

## Hierarchy

Four tiers derived from folder structure.

```text
main                    tier 0 — instance root
atlas                   tier 1 — world
atlas/support           tier 2 — agent
atlas/support/web       tier 3 — worker
```

`root` is the tier-0 folder name.

```typescript
function isRoot(folder: string): boolean {
  return folder === 'root';
}

function permissionTier(folder: string): 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 {
  if (isRoot(folder)) return 0;
  return Math.min(folder.split('/').length, 3) as 1 | 2 | 3;
}
```

Top-level non-root folders are worlds. Depth 2 is a normal agent.
Depth 3+ is clamped to worker. Folders deeper than depth 3 should be
rejected at registration — not yet enforced (see open items below).

## Tier semantics

### Tier 0: instance root

- Can call all existing gateway actions
- Can send to any registered JID
- Can schedule/pause/resume/cancel tasks for any registered group
- Can set routing rules for any registered group
- Can delegate to direct child groups
- Can escalate nothing upward
- Sees `/workspace/self/`

Tier 0 cannot create top-level worlds via action — new worlds are CLI-only. Child groups
inside existing worlds are allowed.

### Tier 1: world

- Scoped to its own world only
- Can send to any registered JID in the same world
- Can schedule and manage tasks in the same world
- Can create direct children in its own world
- Can set routing rules for direct children
- Cannot refresh group metadata globally
- Cannot see `/workspace/self/`
- Cannot see `~/groups`

### Tier 2: agent

- Can send to its own registered JID only
- Can send files to its own registered JID only
- Can schedule/manage tasks for its own group only
- Can delegate to direct child groups
- Can escalate to its direct parent
- Cannot register groups
- Cannot set routing rules

### Tier 3: worker

- Read-mostly container mounts
- Can send text to its own registered JID only
- Cannot send files
- Cannot delegate to children
- Cannot schedule tasks
- Can escalate to its direct parent

## Action authorization

### Messaging

`send_message`:

- tier 0: any target
- tier 1: any registered target in same world (`isInWorld()` check in `messaging.ts`)
- tier 2/3: only own group's registered JID

`send_file`:

- tier 0: any target
- tier 1: any registered target in same world
- tier 2: only own group's registered JID
- tier 3: denied

### Tasks

`schedule_task`, `pause_task`, `resume_task`, `cancel_task`:

- tier 0: any registered target/task
- tier 1: same world only
- tier 2: own group only
- tier 3: denied

### Group management

`register_group`:

- tier 0: allowed for child groups only, not new worlds
- tier 1: allowed for direct children in own world
- tier 2/3: denied

`set_routing_rules`:

- tier 0: any registered group
- tier 1: direct children in own world
- tier 2/3: denied

`delegate_group` (send to `local:{child}` — downward only):

- tier 0: any descendant in any world
- tier 1: any descendant in own subtree
- tier 2: any descendant in own subtree
- tier 3: denied

`escalate_group`:

- tier 2: direct parent only
- tier 3: direct parent only
- tier 0/1: denied
- tier 2/3 at depth 1 (no `/` in folder): throws "unauthorized: no parent group"
- currently fire-and-forget — parent output streams to origin JID, no IPC round-trip

### Session and metadata

`reset_session`: all tiers allowed for their own current group context

`refresh_groups`: tier 0 only

## Action registry

Actions carry a `maxTier` field (named `minTier` in code — semantic debt, rename pending).
`getManifest()` filters out actions where `opts.tier > a.maxTier` — i.e. if the caller's
tier number is higher (less privileged) than the action's `maxTier`, the action is hidden.
Actions without `maxTier` are available to all tiers; per-action handlers do fine-grained
checks beyond that.

## Mount enforcement

Container runner enforces mount restrictions based on tier.
Tier 2 and 3 have no filesystem access to `/workspace/web` — HTTP is always available.

`~` = `/home/node` inside agent containers. `no` = mount is absent entirely.
`—` = not applicable (inherited or overlaid separately).

| Mount                     | Tier 0 | Tier 1 | Tier 2           | Tier 3           |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `/home/node`              | rw     | rw     | rw               | ro               |

## local: routing enforcement

### Where enforcement lives

All `local:` routing rules are enforced in the **action handlers** (`src/actions/`),
not in the router/message loop. Rationale:

- Action handlers run in the gateway process — unreachable by agent code
- `/app/src` is mounted `ro` for tier 2/3; agents cannot modify gateway enforcement
- The IPC request mechanism always passes through gateway validation
- Duplicating rules in the router creates drift; action handlers are the single source

The router/message loop may do a lightweight sanity check on delivery (drop a
`local:` message whose source is not an ancestor of the target) as defense-in-depth,
but this is not the primary gate.

### Rules

**Downward (delegation)** — `delegate_group` / `send_message` to `local:{child}`:

- Sender must be an ancestor of the target folder
- Enforced in `delegate_group` handler and `send_message` handler (target JID check)

**Upward (escalation)** — `escalate_group` only:

- Sender may only target its **direct parent** (one level up, no skipping)
- Enforced in `escalate_group` handler (already checks `lastIndexOf('/')`)
- `send_message` **cannot target `local:` JIDs at all** — local: is internal plumbing,
  not a channel. Only `escalate_group` and `delegate_group` produce `local:`-routed messages.

**Tier 0/1 cannot escalate** — already enforced (no parent exists).

### Why not the router?

The agent controls what IPC requests it writes. If enforcement were only in the
router, a misconfigured or prompt-injected agent could write a crafted IPC request
that bypasses action-level checks and reaches the router with an arbitrary target.
The action handler validates the request before it ever produces a routable message,
closing that gap.

## Delegation prompt format

When a parent delegates down via `delegate_group`, the gateway wraps the prompt
in an XML tag before sending to the child container:

```xml
<delegated_by group="atlas">
  ...original prompt...
</delegated_by>
```

The child always knows it was delegated (also via `NANOCLAW_DELEGATE_DEPTH > 0` env var).
The parent does not receive the child's result — delegation is fire-and-forget routing.
The child replies directly to `chatJid`.

## Shipped (previously open)

- **Depth rejection**: `register_group` now rejects folders deeper than 3 levels.
- **maxTier rename**: `minTier` renamed to `maxTier` throughout — tier 0 = most privileged.
- **Tier auth for send_message/send_file**: `assertAuthorized` uses `isInWorld` for all non-root
  tiers; tier 2 agents can send to any JID routed within their world.
- **Main → root**: `isRoot()` checks `folder === 'root'`; CLI defaults new instances to `root`;
  `'main'` wiped from all source and test files.

## Open items

### Escalation response protocol

`escalate_group` is currently fire-and-forget: parent runs and replies to the original
`chatJid` directly, bypassing the worker entirely.

**Intended behaviour**: when a worker escalates, the parent runs with `chatJid` set to the
**worker's own registered JID** (not the original user JID). The parent's reply is then
routed as a normal incoming message back to the worker. The worker gets a fresh turn,
sees the parent's answer in conversation context, and replies to the original user.

```
user → worker (chatJid = user_jid)
  worker calls escalate_group(prompt)
    → parent container runs with chatJid = worker_jid
      → parent replies → routed to worker as new message
        → worker processes answer + history → replies to user_jid
```

No special IPC injection needed — escalation reuses the normal routing pipeline.
The parent is unaware it is servicing an escalation; it simply answers whoever
sent the message.

**Design: `local:` JID namespace**

Every registered group gets a guaranteed synthetic JID: `local:{folder}`.

- Created automatically at group registration time (no setup required)
- `routes` entry: `local:atlas/support → atlas/support`
- Never exposed to external channels — internal routing only
- Mirrors the existing `web:{folder}` pattern

**Escalation flow with `local:` JIDs:**

1. Worker (`atlas/support`) bound to `chatJid = telegram:xxx` with triggering `messageId = "789"`,
   calls `escalate_group(prompt)`
2. Gateway fires parent (`atlas`) with `chatJid = local:atlas/support`, wrapping the prompt.
   The wrapper includes the original message compacted (sender + ID + truncated content),
   mirroring how `<reply_to>` works in the router:
   ```xml
   <escalation from="atlas/support" reply_to="telegram:xxx" reply_id="789">
     <original_message sender="John" id="789">the user's original message text…</original_message>
     ...worker's escalated prompt...
   </escalation>
   ```
3. Parent processes, calls `send_reply(text)` → bound to `local:atlas/support` → normal router
4. Message stored with `chatJid = local:atlas/support`, routed to `atlas/support` folder
5. Worker gets fresh turn; session history has `reply_to`, `reply_id`, and original message
   from step 2 — all visible in the `.jl` transcript
6. Worker calls `send_message(telegram:xxx, text, replyTo: '789')` — NOT `send_reply`

The return address and message ID travel in the prompt body — same pattern as `<delegated_by>`.
No extra DB fields, no new mechanisms. The parent is unaware it is servicing an escalation.
If the worker needs more history context, it can read `~/.claude/projects/-home-node/<id>.jl`
(the session transcript) — this is standard agent capability, no new action needed.

**Message ID format**: `NewMessage.id` is the raw channel-native string (e.g. `"789"` for
Telegram, a snowflake for Discord). Channel prefix in `reply_to` JID (`telegram:xxx`)
tells the channel handler how to interpret it:

| Channel  | `reply_id` type   | Channel send call                                                    |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Telegram | integer string    | `reply_parameters: { message_id: Number(id) }` — already implemented |
| Discord  | snowflake string  | `message.reply()` — not yet implemented                              |
| WhatsApp | stanza ID         | requires quoted message object — deferred                            |
| Mastodon | status ID         | `client.reply(id, text)` — stub exists                               |
| Email    | Message-ID header | `In-Reply-To` — handled separately via thread                        |

**`reply_id` source**: `ContainerInput` gains `messageId?: string` (the triggering
`NewMessage.id`). Gateway stamps it in the `<escalation>` XML automatically — the agent
does not need to know or pass it explicitly.

**`original_message` content**: gateway reads the triggering `NewMessage` from the messages
table to get `sender_name`, `id`, and truncated content. Max 200 chars — same limit as
`reply_to_text`. If message not found, omit `<original_message>` block.

**Reply threading**: `send_message` gains an optional `replyTo` field. The worker reads
`reply_id` from session history and passes it as `replyTo` — Telegram threads the reply
to the original user message. Channels without threading support ignore it gracefully.

**Maximum one escalation level** — no recursive chaining.

**Circuit breaker**: `escalate_group` passes `depth + 1` to the parent. If parent tries
to escalate again (`depth = 1`), `depth >= MAX_DELEGATE_DEPTH` rejects it.
Set `MAX_DELEGATE_DEPTH = 1`. No new code — constant change only.

**Required changes:**

- `register_group`: insert `local:{folder}` into `routes` table alongside any channel JID
- `src/types.ts` / `ContainerInput`: add `messageId?: string` (populated from triggering `NewMessage.id`)
- `src/action-registry.ts` `ActionContext`: add `chatJid: string`, `messageId?: string`
- `src/ipc.ts` `buildContext`: extract `chatJid` and `messageId` from IPC request JSON
- `src/index.ts`: pass `messageId` into `ContainerInput` and into delegate/escalate calls
- `escalate_group` handler: change `chatJid` arg to `local:{ctx.sourceGroup}`; build
  `<escalation from=... reply_to="{ctx.chatJid}" reply_id="{ctx.messageId}">` XML;
  fetch original message from DB for `<original_message>` block
- `send_message` action: add optional `replyTo?: string`; pass as `SendOpts` to `ctx.sendMessage`
- `ActionContext.sendMessage`: signature becomes `(jid, text, opts?: SendOpts) => Promise<void>`
- `MAX_DELEGATE_DEPTH = 1`

Normal reply flow handles everything else. `local:` has no channel handler — no external send.

### Host/web actions

Web virtual host management deferred to `8-web-virtual-hosts.md`.
