## [Unreleased]

---

## [v0.1.2] — 2026-03-01

### Added

- Signal-driven IPC: gateway sends SIGUSR1 after writing IPC file; agent
  wakes immediately, falls back to 500ms poll — eliminates busy-waiting

### Fixed

- Race condition in wakeup/timer assignment in agent IPC polling
- `cleanupOrphans` dual-filter restored to OR logic (AND regression in v0.1.1)
- Typing indicator now stops correctly when agent finishes responding
- Extracted `signalContainer` and `scanGroupFolders` helpers to deduplicate
  signal-sending logic

---

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-03-01

### Added

- Skills consolidated into `container/skills/`; seeded once per group on
  first container run
- Vite web server integrated into gateway startup via IPC restart
- Web app template seeded from `template/web/` on `kanipi create`
- Group management CLI (`kanipi group list|add|rm <instance>`)
- `hello` and `howto` skills bundled in agent image
- Pre-commit hooks: prettier, typecheck, hygiene (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
- Makefile targets: `build`, `lint`, `test`
- Discord channel via discord.js (`channels/discord.ts`)
- Env-based channel toggling: Telegram by `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, Discord by
  `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, WhatsApp by `store/auth/creds.json` presence

### Changed

- `TELEGRAM_ONLY` flag removed; channel selection is token/credential-driven
- Unified `ChannelOpts` type across all three channel modules

### Fixed

- Render markdown as HTML in Telegram; keep typing indicator alive during
  long responses
- Agent-team subcontainers cleaned up on gateway startup
- Fallback to script-relative template dir when not running inside container
- Docker-in-docker mount paths and agent container write permissions
- Bootstrap chicken-and-egg: `group add` now creates DB schema if missing
- `appDir` used for skills source path instead of `process.cwd()`

---

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-03-01

Initial kanipi release — nanoclaw fork with Telegram support and
multitenant instance model.

### Added

- Fork of nanoclaw at upstream v1.1.3
- Telegram channel (`channels/telegram.ts` via grammy)
- `kanipi` bash entrypoint: `create`, `group`, and instance-run commands
- Per-instance data layout: `/srv/data/kanipi_<name>/`
- systemd unit file templating via `kanipi create <name>`
- `container/agent-runner/` in-container Claude Code entrypoint
- Docker-in-docker host path translation (`detectHostPath()` via
  `/proc/self/mountinfo`)

### Inherited from nanoclaw v1.1.x

- Mount project root read-only (container escape prevention)
- Symlink and path-escape blocking in skills file ops
- `fetchLatestWaWebVersion` to prevent WhatsApp 405 failures
- Host timezone propagation to agent container
- `assistantName` passed to agent (was hardcoded as `'Andy'`)
- Idle preemption correctly triggered for scheduled tasks
