### Code hosting / VCS

- [x] `gh` — GitHub CLI: issues, PRs, releases, gists, Actions

### Data / query

- [x] `sqlite3` — explicit CLI (query local DBs, not just via Python)
- [x] `duckdb` — in-process analytics on CSV/JSON/parquet, no server needed
- [x] `psql` — Postgres client (pg_dump, query remote DBs)
- [x] `redis-cli` — query Redis instances
- [ ] `xsv` — fast CSV slicing/sorting/joining (Rust, single binary)
- [x] `yq` — YAML processor (jq for YAML; configs, k8s, CI files)
- [x] `miller` — stream CSV/JSON/TSV like awk (complements xsv)

### HTTP / API / network

- [ ] `xh` — modern curl alternative (Rust httpie; cleaner API testing output)
- [ ] `websocat` — WebSocket client/server for testing WS endpoints
- [x] `grpcurl` — gRPC reflection + call testing
- [ ] `hurl` — file-based HTTP test sequences (CI-friendly)
- [x] `socat` — bidirectional data relay; Unix socket debugging

### Git / diff

- [x] `delta` — syntax-highlighted git diffs (agent-readable output)
- [x] `shfmt` — shell script formatter (pair with shellcheck)

### Linting / static analysis

- [x] `hadolint` — Dockerfile linter
- [x] `sqlfluff` — SQL formatter and linter
- [x] `semgrep` — multi-language static analysis / secret scanning
- [ ] `yamllint` — YAML strict linter (catches tab issues, duplicates)
- [ ] `vale` — prose linter (docs, changelogs, READMEs)

### Build / task runners

- [ ] `just` — justfile task runner (simpler make; one per project)
- [ ] `watchexec` — re-run commands on file change (dev loops)
- [ ] `hyperfine` — command benchmarking with stats

### Load / perf testing

- [ ] `k6` — scriptable HTTP load testing (JS scripts)

### Diagrams / visualization

- [x] `graphviz` — dot → SVG/PNG (architecture, dependency graphs)
- [ ] `gnuplot` — terminal/file plotting from data
- [ ] `typst` — modern typesetting (PDF reports, whitepapers; lighter than LaTeX)

### Media / documents

- [x] `ghostscript` — PDF merge/split/compress
- [x] `exiftool` — read/write media metadata
- [x] `sox` — audio format conversion and processing
- [x] `mediainfo` — detailed media file inspection
- [x] `qrencode` — generate QR codes from CLI

### Security / secrets

- [ ] `age` — modern file encryption (replaces GPG for most cases)
- [ ] `sops` — encrypted secrets files (YAML/JSON/env with age/GPG keys)

### Infrastructure

- [ ] `kubectl` — Kubernetes cluster management
- [ ] `opentofu` — IaC (open Terraform fork; provision cloud resources)
- [ ] `aws` CLI — S3, Lambda, ECR, CloudWatch from agent

### Blockchain / crypto

- [ ] `solana` CLI — keypairs, airdrop, deploy, account queries (Atlas/Marinade)
- [ ] `cast` (Foundry) — EVM: call contracts, send txs, decode data

No binary tools needed for: Hyperliquid (`hyperliquid-python-sdk` / REST+WS),
Ethereum (`web3` py / `viem` js), Polymarket (`py-clob-client` / REST).
Install on-demand with `uv pip install` or `bun add`.

### Runtime (one new language)

- [ ] `ruby` — scripting, Jekyll, occasional gem tooling

### Misc CLI

- [x] `parallel` — GNU parallel; fan-out batch operations
- [ ] `hexyl` — hex dump with ASCII sidebar (binary file inspection)
- [x] `rsync` — efficient file sync (local and remote)
- [ ] `mkcert` — locally-trusted dev HTTPS certs
- [x] `ps`/`free` extras — `sysstat` package for `sar`, `iostat`, `mpstat` (scriptable, not TUI)

## On-demand

- [ ] semantic search: embeddings MCP server (on demand)

## Arizuko — deferred to new instance

Requires architectural changes or new instance setup. Do not ship to marinade.

- [ ] unified home dir: groups/{folder} → /home/node, remove /workspace/group
- [x] dash-memory: diary/memory editor
- [ ] evangelist: community engagement agent (4/R)
- [x] gmail channel: dropped — generic IMAP email channel handles Gmail fine
- [ ] instance-repos: git-based config deployment (5/G)
- [ ] agent-pipeline: multi-hop routing, continuation payloads (5/2)
- [ ] ipc-mcp-proxy: unix socket replaces file IPC (5/A)
- [ ] workflows: multi-step workflow primitives (5/N)
- [ ] plugins: dynamic channel/feature loading (5/E)

## Licensing

- [ ] adopt AGPL v3 — arizuko has switched; port LICENSE file and README
      philosophy section. AGPL closes the SaaS loophole: modify + run as a
      service = share source. Channel adapters / API consumers unaffected.

## Dropped

- agent-routing (4/1): superseded by nested groups + routing rules (already shipped)
- stream-stall timeout: canceled
